# ``AsyncOperations``

Adds the capability of async operations.

## Overview
`AsyncOperations` provides asynchronous operations for generic higher-order functions like `map` and `filter`.

This library provides two features.

1. Async functions of `Sequence`.
2. Ordered Task Group

### Async functions of `Sequence`.
Original functions of `Sequence` don't support Swift Concurrency and 
async function is not available in like a `forEach` closure.
```swift
[1, 2, 3].forEach { number in
    // üò¢ async function is not available here.
}
```

This library provides async operations like `asyncForEach` and `asyncMap`.

```swift
try await [1, 2, 3].asyncForEach { number in
    print("Start: \(number)")
    try await doSomething(number) // üòÅ async function is available here.
    print("End: \(number)")
}
```

The closure runs sequential as a default behavior.

```
Start: 1
End: 1
Start: 2
End: 2
Start: 3
End: 3
```

As an advanced usage, `numberOfConcurrentTasks` can be specified and the closure can run in parallel if the value is 2 or more.
```swift
try await [1, 2, 3].asyncForEach(numberOfConcurrentTasks: 3) { number in
    print("Start: \(number)")
    try await doSomething(number)
    print("End: \(number)")
}
```

```
Start: 2
End: 2
Start: 1
Start: 3
End: 3
End: 1
```

The extended functions perform parallel execution even for order-sensitive functions like `map` function, 
transforming the array while preserving the original order.
```swift
let result = try await [1, 2, 3].asyncMap(numberOfConcurrentTasks: 3) { number in
    print("Start: \(number)")
    let result = try await twice(number)
    print("End: \(number)")
    return result
}
print(result)
```

```
Start: 1
Start: 3
End: 3
End: 1
Start: 2
End: 2
[2, 4, 6]
```
This library provides
- `asyncForEach`
- `asyncMap`
- `asyncFlatMap`
- `asyncCompactMap`
- `asyncFilter`
- `asyncFirst`
- `asyncAllSatisfy`
- `asyncContains`
- `asyncReduce`

### Ordered Task Group
The original utility function `withTaskGroup` and `withThrowingTaskGroup` don't ensure the order of `for await`.
```swift
let results = await withTaskGroup(of: Int.self) { group in
    (0..<5).forEach { number in
        group.addTask {
            await Task.yield()
            return number * 2
        }
    }
    var results: [Int] = []
    for await number in group {
        results.append(number)
    }
    return results
}
print(results) // ‚òπÔ∏è [0, 4, 2, 6, 10, 8]
```

However, ordered `for await` is required in some of situations like converting an array to a new array.

`withOrderedTaskGroup` and `withThrowingOrderedTaskGroup` satisfy such requirements.
```swift
let results = await withOrderedTaskGroup(of: Int.self) { group in
    (0..<5).forEach { number in
        group.addTask {
            await Task.yield()
            return number * 2
        }
    }
    var results: [Int] = []
    for await number in group {
        results.append(number)
    }
    return results
}
print(results) // üòÅ [0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10]
```

They are also used for async functions of `Sequence`.
